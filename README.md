# BTree-Pretty-Print
This is a BTree class made on c++ which lets you print it on a pretty graphical way.

Made by: Omar Garduza and Emiliano Carrillo

DISCLAIMER: We are not the owner of the entire class. We fixed the value deletion methods and added the printTree and printPage functions entirely.
